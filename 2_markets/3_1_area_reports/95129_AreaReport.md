# ZIP Code 95129 — San José, California
*Santa Clara County | West San José / Cupertino Border | School-Driven, Low-Inventory, Premium Submarket*

## 1. Geological & Physical Setting

### 1.1 Geographic Position
ZIP **95129** sits in **West San José**, directly adjacent to **Cupertino (95014)** and near Saratoga (95070) and Campbell (95008). It is often treated by buyers as a “Cupertino-adjacent” market because school assignment and commute access can resemble West Valley dynamics depending on the exact address.

### 1.2 Natural Boundaries & Topography
- Mostly **flat to gently sloping valley-floor terrain**.
- Compared with eastern San José ZIPs, fewer hillside-driven constraints; lot usability is generally strong.
- Drainage is largely engineered; address-level low points can matter after storms.

### 1.3 Land Use Patterns
- Predominantly single-family residential with scattered townhome/condo pockets.
- Commercial corridors along major arterials; interior tracts are quieter and more owner-occupied.
- Built-out with supply changes driven mainly by remodels, rebuilds, and ADUs.

## 2. Climate & Environmental Hazards

### 2.1 Climate
Warm summers, mild winters; typical South Bay valley climate.

### 2.2 Wildfire
Generally low wildfire exposure versus foothill/WUI zones, but verify address-level FHSZ status near any open-space edges.

### 2.3 Flood/Stormwater
Typically localized stormwater issues rather than broad floodplains; FEMA check remains standard diligence.

### 2.4 Seismic
Baseline Bay Area seismic profile; diligence focuses on foundation performance and any retrofit history.

### 2.5 Environmental
Primarily residential; address- and disclosure-driven diligence is appropriate.

## 3. Community & Demographics

### 3.1 Neighborhood Structure
95129 is tract-defined, with buyer segmentation commonly driven by:
- School assignment
- Interior tract vs corridor adjacency
- Remodel/rebuild quality and permit history

### 3.2 Population Profile
High proportion of professional households and family buyers; strong owner occupancy and low turnover in many tracts.

### 3.3 Household Characteristics
Family-oriented and school-driven demand; dual-income tech households are common.

---

## 4. Housing & Neighborhood Character

### 4.1 Housing Stock
- Many homes are **1960s–1970s ranches and split-levels**, with extensive remodel and rebuild activity.
- Lots are often moderate-sized with strong usability, supporting expansions/ADUs where zoning permits.
- Common diligence themes:
  - Electrical service upgrades
  - Sewer laterals (older tracts)
  - Permit history for additions and conversions

### 4.2 Market Position (Directional)
95129 is generally treated as a **premium San José ZIP** because:
- It can offer access to highly regarded school pathways (address-specific)
- Commutes to Cupertino/Sunnyvale/Mountain View are practical
- Inventory is constrained, and “move-in ready” homes command large premiums
Pricing is heavily segmented by school assignment and micro-location.

### 4.3 Income & Affordability
High-income profile; affordability constrained even for strong buyers. Homes with top school assignment often trade at premiums comparable to neighboring “brand-name” cities.

### 4.4 Rental Market
Strong executive-family rental demand tied to schools; limited inventory.

---

## 5. Commute & Access

### 5.1 Transportation
Excellent corridor access via:
- I-280 and SR-85 (location-dependent)
- Major arterials supporting Cupertino and Sunnyvale access

### 5.2 Commute Patterns (Directional)
- Cupertino / Apple Park: often very short-to-moderate commute
- Sunnyvale / Mountain View: short-to-moderate
- North San José: moderate depending on route and peak congestion
Transit-to-SF commutes are feasible but usually require transfers and last-mile planning.

### 5.3 Constraints
Peak-hour congestion and school-hour traffic are practical constraints; corridor selection and “cut-through” dynamics can matter by neighborhood.

---

## 6. Economic Development & Outlook

### 6.1 Demand Drivers
Demand is supported by:
- Proximity to West Valley tech campuses
- School-driven buying demand
- Tight supply and high owner occupancy

### 6.2 Commercial Activity
Neighborhood retail and corridor commercial uses; buyers value quiet interior tracts.

### 6.3 Development Trends
- Strong remodel/rebuild cycle
- ADU additions increasing
- Limited large-scale new supply

### 6.4 Outlook
Long-term capital-preservation profile, with cyclical sensitivity to rates but strong structural demand from schools and job access.

---

## 7. Safety
Generally low violent crime; property crime exists but is typically manageable. Interior tracts tend to feel quieter than corridor-adjacent nodes.

---

## 8. Schools & Education (Critical in 95129)
School assignment is **address-based** and is one of the most important drivers of demand and pricing.
Common pathways may include parts of:
- Cupertino Union School District (some pockets)
- Moreland / Campbell-area elementary districts (in some areas)
- High school districts can vary; boundary verification is essential.

### Buyer Guidance
Do not infer schools from ZIP. Verify the exact address using official district boundary tools before forming offer strategy.

## Practical Due-Diligence Checklist (95129)
1. Verify school assignment by exact address (elementary → middle → high).
2. Evaluate corridor noise/air-quality exposure vs interior tract premiums.
3. Confirm FEMA flood zone; inspect drainage.
4. For older tracts, evaluate electrical capacity, sewer laterals, and permits.
5. Confirm ADU/expansion feasibility and any zoning constraints for future value.
