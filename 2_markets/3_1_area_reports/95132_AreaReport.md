# ZIP Code 95132 — San José, California
*Santa Clara County | Berryessa / North-East San José | Suburban Hills + Valley-Floor Tracts*

## 1. Geological & Physical Setting

### 1.1 Geographic Position
ZIP **95132** is generally associated with **Berryessa** and parts of **north‑east San José**, positioned south of Milpitas and northeast of Downtown San José. It sits between the North San José employment corridor and the first foothill rises toward the Diablo Range.

### 1.2 Natural Boundaries & Topography
95132 is more topographically diverse than many central-valley San José ZIPs:
- **Valley-floor neighborhoods** (flatter tracts with classic suburban blocks)
- **Lower foothill / rolling-slope neighborhoods** (more grade change, retaining walls, stepped lots, and drainage complexity)
- Local drainage is creek- and channel-influenced; stormwater behavior is often micro-location driven (rear-yard swales, side-yard flow, and street crown design in older tracts).

### 1.3 Land Use Patterns
- Predominantly **single-family residential**, with pockets of townhomes/condos.
- Neighborhood-serving retail and services along major arterials (Berryessa Rd / Capitol Ave influences).
- Commute practicality is a central value driver due to access to major job nodes and transit.

## 2. Climate & Environmental Hazards

### 2.1 Local Climate & Weather Patterns
Mediterranean valley climate: warm, dry summers and mild winters. Compared with Peninsula coastal ZIPs, 95132 typically runs warmer in summer afternoons with less marine-layer moderation.

### 2.2 Wildfire Exposure & Historical Fire Activity
Wildfire exposure in 95132 is generally **lower than true wildland-interface foothill communities**, but the **foothill-adjacent edges** can present higher vegetation/ember considerations. The County and local fire agencies emphasize using the **Fire Hazard Severity Zone (FHSZ) maps** and CAL FIRE’s interactive mapping for address-level verification. 

Practical implications if a property is mapped in higher hazard tiers:
- Defensible space and vegetation management expectations
- Higher insurance underwriting sensitivity (carrier-specific)
- Remodel/new build standards may be stricter (ignition-resistant details), depending on jurisdiction and mapped zone

### 2.3 Flood, Stormwater, and Water-Related Hazards
Flood risk tends to be **localized**—often tied to creek proximity, low points, or stormwater conveyance limitations rather than broad floodplain exposure. Best practice is to check the exact address using FEMA’s Flood Map Service Center. 

### 2.4 Seismic Activity & Fault Proximity
95132 has the baseline Bay Area seismic profile. For buyers, the highest-value diligence usually focuses on:
- Foundation performance (slab vs raised) and signs of settlement
- Condition of retaining walls where present
- Drainage management (water is often the accelerant for slope/retaining issues)

### 2.5 Environmental Compliance, Pollution Indicators
Residential diligence is typically property-specific:
- Confirm any disclosed past underground tanks (older homes), major grading, or drainage alterations
- For homes near commercial corridors or former industrial parcels, review disclosures and any available environmental documentation (address context matters)

## 3. Community & Demographics

### 3.1 Communities, Neighborhoods, and Subdivisions
95132 commonly maps to **Berryessa** and tract-defined neighborhoods. Buyers often segment by:
- Valley-floor tract neighborhoods (more uniform lots and street grids)
- Foothill-influenced tracts (more view lots and grade variance)
- Proximity to the Berryessa transit node and shopping corridors

### 3.2 Population Size, Density & Demographic Composition
Mixed owner/renter composition with strong professional workforce representation. Density varies sharply with housing type and proximity to arterials and multifamily nodes.

### 3.3 Household Characteristics
Typical patterns include:
- Family households in single-family tracts
- Professionals and commuters prioritizing transit/freeway access
- Some multi-generational household patterns (property-type dependent)

---

## 4. Housing & Neighborhood Character

### 4.1 Housing Stock Distribution & Architectural Character
- Predominantly **single-family homes** (many mid-century to late-20th-century tracts) with ongoing remodel activity.
- Townhomes/condos exist, often nearer arterials and employment/transit connections.
- Common diligence themes:
  - Electrical capacity (panel upgrades), especially in older homes
  - Sewer lateral condition (older tracts)
  - Drainage and retaining performance on sloped lots

### 4.2 Pricing, Trends & Affordability (Directional)
95132 is generally positioned as a **mid-to-upper tier** San José ZIP, with pricing highly segmented by:
- School attendance assignment
- Lot usability (flat vs steep / retaining dependence)
- Remodel quality and permits
- Noise/air-quality exposure near arterials

*(If you want numeric medians and time-series trends, I can generate them, but I will source them explicitly from MLS/Redfin/Zillow or county data rather than estimating.)*

### 4.3 Income Distribution & Median Household Income
Generally elevated for San José, but varies by micro-area and housing type.

### 4.4 Rental Market Snapshot
Stable rental demand supported by commute practicality; strongest for single-family rentals tied to school access and for townhome rentals near transit and corridors.

## 5. Commute & Access

### 5.1 Major Roadways, Transit Access & Walkability
95132 benefits from strong access to the broader Silicon Valley network (US‑101 / I‑680 / I‑880 connectivity varies by exact address). Walkability is mixed: higher near retail corridors; car-dependent in most interior tracts.

A major differentiator is proximity to **Berryessa/North San José BART**, which opened for passenger service **June 13, 2020**, improving regional transit access for parts of the broader Berryessa area. 

### 5.2 Typical Commute Patterns (Directional)
- North San José / Santa Clara / Sunnyvale: typically short-to-moderate drive times
- Peninsula job nodes: feasible but time-of-day sensitive; transit mode may be attractive for some commute profiles depending on last-mile requirements

### 5.3 Infrastructure Constraints & Planned Improvements
Primary constraints are peak-hour corridor congestion and school-hour traffic. Improvements tend to focus on intersection performance and multimodal safety rather than major new roadway capacity.

---

## 6. Economic Development & Outlook

### 6.1 Major Employers Within or Near the ZIP Code
The ZIP is primarily residential, but demand is supported by adjacency to North San José employment nodes and broad Silicon Valley job centers.

### 6.2 Local Business Environment & Commercial Activity
Neighborhood-serving retail, services, and corridor commercial uses dominate. Large-format employment is more pronounced in nearby North San José corridors than deep inside residential tracts.

### 6.3 Development Trends, Pipeline Projects & Market Outlook
- Remodeling and ADU additions remain common.
- Limited greenfield opportunity; infill is the dominant change mechanism.
- Long-run outlook is typically supported by job accessibility and transit enhancements, subject to rate cycles and tech hiring volatility.

### 6.4 Resident Sentiment & Public Opinion Indicators
Typical themes: traffic management, school quality, neighborhood preservation, and wildfire-preparedness (especially for foothill edges).

---

## 7. Safety

### 7.1 Overall Crime Levels & Comparisons
As with most large-city ZIPs, micro-location matters more than ZIP averages. Interior residential tracts typically feel quieter than corridor-adjacent nodes.

### 7.2 Violent vs. Property Crime Rates
Property crime (vehicle-related incidents, petty theft) is usually the more relevant diligence category than violent crime for many buyers.

### 7.3 Neighborhood-Level Safety Concerns
- Corridor adjacency can increase nuisance/property incidents.
- Foothill edges may raise emergency-access considerations (narrow streets, vegetation, defensible space).

---

## 8. Schools & Education

### 8.1 Elementary Schools
A substantial portion of 95132 is served by **Berryessa Union School District (BUSD)** (K–8). BUSD provides an official **SchoolFinder** tool for address-based assignment. 

### 8.2 Middle Schools
BUSD includes multiple middle schools serving the area; address-based assignment remains the governing rule. BUSD publishes school listings and district resources. 

### 8.3 High Schools
High school assignment for Berryessa-area addresses is commonly within **East Side Union High School District (ESUHSD)**. ESUHSD provides a **Boundaries** page and attendance-area locator guidance for accurate address-level determination. 

### 8.4 Private, Charter & Alternative Options
Private and alternative options exist across San José and nearby cities, but public attendance assignment remains a primary driver of pricing and demand.

### 8.5 Performance Metrics & Boundary Considerations
For 95132, **school boundaries materially affect buyer demand**. Verification must be done by exact address using BUSD and ESUHSD tools; ZIP alone is not sufficient.

## Practical Due‑Diligence Checklist (95132-specific)
1. **Schools:** verify BUSD (K–8) and ESUHSD (9–12) attendance by exact address using official locators. 
2. **Fire hazard:** check the County/CAL FIRE FHSZ and WUI layers for foothill-edge properties. 
3. **Flood/drainage:** confirm FEMA flood zone; inspect site drainage performance, especially on sloped lots.
4. **Slope/retaining:** for hillside lots, evaluate retaining walls, surface drainage, and any signs of movement or water intrusion.  
5. **Noise/access:** measure corridor exposure (arterials/freeways) versus interior-tract quiet, and price the tradeoff explicitly.  
6. **Transit value:** if commute-to-Oakland/SF/inner East Bay matters, quantify proximity and last-mile friction to Berryessa BART.
