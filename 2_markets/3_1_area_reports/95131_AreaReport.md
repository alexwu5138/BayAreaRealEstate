# ZIP Code 95131 — San José, California
*Santa Clara County | North San José / Berryessa-adjacent | Tech-Employment Corridor + Residential Tracts*

## 1. Geological & Physical Setting

### 1.1 Geographic Position
ZIP **95131** sits in **North San José**, generally north of Downtown San José and south/southeast of Milpitas, within the broader “North San José” submarket.

Source for general ZIP profile: https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/95131/ 

### 1.2 Natural Boundaries & Topography
- Predominantly **flat Santa Clara Valley floor** (alluvial plain), historically orchard/agricultural land before large-scale industrial and residential buildout.
- Local drainage corridors and engineered stormwater infrastructure are typical; steep slopes are not the defining feature (unlike foothill/WUI communities).

### 1.3 Land Use Patterns
95131 is a classic **mixed employment + residential** ZIP:
- **Employment/R&D/office/light industrial** pockets (North First Street / Tasman corridor influences nearby).
- **Residential tracts** (single-family neighborhoods and townhome/condo clusters).
- Commercial and services concentrate along arterials; interior residential streets are quieter and more stable.

## 2. Climate & Environmental Hazards

### 2.1 Local Climate & Weather Patterns
Mediterranean valley climate: warm, dry summers and mild winters. Compared with Peninsula coastal ZIPs, 95131 typically experiences **warmer summer afternoons** with less marine-layer persistence.

### 2.2 Wildfire Exposure & Historical Fire Activity
For most of 95131, wildfire exposure is **lower than foothill / WUI ZIP codes**. Address-level verification is still prudent for any property near open-space edges or large riparian corridors (where embers and wind events can still be relevant). California’s fire-hazard framework is driven by Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ) and local adoption/implementation (property-specific).

### 2.3 Flood, Stormwater, and Water-Related Hazards
Flood risk in 95131 is typically **localized**, depending on micro-topography, stormwater conveyance, and proximity to mapped flood features. Best practice is to run the exact address through FEMA’s Flood Map Service Center (MSC) rather than inferring from the ZIP.

### 2.4 Seismic Activity & Fault Proximity
95131 has the baseline Bay Area seismic profile:
- Practical diligence tends to be more valuable than generalized fault-distance statements.
- For older housing stock, confirm foundation type, settlement indicators, and retrofit status where applicable.

### 2.5 Environmental Compliance, Pollution Indicators
North San José has long-standing **electronics/tech industrial history** in the broader region. For residential diligence, the practical approach is:
- Review seller disclosures for any environmental notices.
- If a property is near known remediation areas or industrial parcels, request and review environmental documentation (site-specific rather than ZIP-wide assumptions).

### 3.1 Communities, Neighborhoods, and Subdivisions
“North San José” is often described as spanning multiple ZIP codes (including 95131 among them) in brokerage market guides. 
Within 95131, neighborhoods are typically tract-defined (mid‑century tracts in some pockets; newer planned townhome communities in others).

### 3.2 Population Size, Density & Demographic Composition

### 3.3 Household Characteristics
Common patterns include:
- Professional/technical workforce concentration
- High share of dual-income households
- Multi-generational living appears in some tracts (property type dependent)

---

## 4. Housing & Neighborhood Character

### 4.1 Housing Stock Distribution & Architectural Character
- **Single-family homes** (often 1960s–1980s era in older tracts, depending on micro-area).
- **Townhomes/condos** in planned developments, often closer to arterials and employment corridors.
- Common physical diligence themes:
  - Electrical capacity and panel upgrades (home-age dependent)
  - Sewer lateral condition (older tracts)
  - Noise/air-quality tradeoffs for corridor-adjacent properties

### 4.2 Market & Pricing (sourced snapshot; verify current)
A public market overview (which updates over time) reports a **median sale price** for 95131 and related market metrics. Treat this as a directional reference and confirm via MLS/Redfin for current contract strategy. 

### 4.3 Income Distribution & Affordability
Affordability is constrained by proximity to Silicon Valley employment centers and limited land for new low-density supply. Pricing is segmented heavily by:
- Property type (SFH vs townhouse/condo)
- Exact neighborhood + corridor proximity
- Remodel quality and permit history

### 4.4 Rental Market Snapshot
Rental demand is supported by:
- Proximity to North San José and adjacent employment nodes
- Townhome/condo supply relative to nearby ZIPs
A public market overview reports a median rent figure (changes over time; verify current).

## 5. Commute & Access

### 5.1 Major Roadways, Transit Access & Walkability
95131 benefits from strong access to regional corridors (US‑101 / I‑880 / I‑280 / SR‑87 influences depending on the exact address). Walkability varies: corridor-adjacent areas can be more walkable to services, while interior tracts are primarily car-oriented.

### 5.2 Typical Commute Times (directional)
- North San José / Santa Clara / Sunnyvale job nodes: generally short-to-moderate drive times.
- Peninsula or SF commutes: feasible but time-of-day sensitive; mode choice depends on the nearest rail/BART/Caltrain access (often requiring a drive/transfer).

### 5.3 Infrastructure Constraints & Planned Improvements
The key constraint is **peak-hour congestion** on major corridors; local improvements tend to focus on intersection performance, bike/ped safety, and corridor operations rather than major new roadway capacity.

## 6. Economic Development & Outlook

### 6.1 Major Employers Within or Near the ZIP Code
North San José is a major tech employment corridor. Examples of large campus presence in the broader North San José area include:
- Cisco’s San José campus footprint (campus mapping documentation). 
- Samsung Semiconductor’s Silicon Valley campus presence in San José (regional anchor employer). 

### 6.2 Local Business Environment & Commercial Activity
Commercial activity clusters along arterials and near employment corridors. The ZIP’s economy is strongly influenced by Silicon Valley office/R&D demand cycles.

### 6.3 Development Trends & Outlook
- Incremental redevelopment/infill is more common than major greenfield expansion.
- Housing demand is supported by job proximity, but is sensitive to interest-rate cycles and tech hiring volatility.
- Long-term desirability tends to track accessibility and the strength of the North San José employment base.

### 6.4 Resident Sentiment & Public Opinion Indicators
Common themes include traffic management, housing supply tradeoffs, school assignment clarity, and quality-of-life improvements near major corridors.

## 7. Safety

### 7.1 Overall Crime Levels & Comparisons
ZIP-level safety narratives can be misleading; micro-location matters. In practice:
- Corridor-adjacent areas may see more opportunistic property crime.
- Interior residential tracts are typically quieter.

### 7.2 Violent vs. Property Crime
Property crime (vehicle-related incidents, petty theft) is generally the more relevant diligence category than violent crime for most buyers.

---

## 8. Schools & Education

### 8.1 Elementary Schools (K–8)
A substantial portion of 95131 is served by **Berryessa Union School District (BUSD)** (address-based assignment). Official district resources and school locator tools should be used for verification.

### 8.2 High Schools
BUSD notes that its students attend high school within the **East Side Union High School District (ESUHSD)** (address-based attendance). 

### 8.3 Boundary Considerations
For offer strategy and pricing expectations, **verify school attendance by address** using official district tools; do not infer from ZIP alone.

## Practical Due-Diligence Checklist (95131-specific)
1. **Flood check:** run the exact address through FEMA MSC and save the panel/map output. 
2. **Schools:** verify BUSD/ESUHSD attendance by address (ZIP ≠ guaranteed assignment).  
3. **Corridor tradeoffs:** assess noise and air-quality exposure near major arterials/expressways versus interior tracts.  
4. **Home-age risks:** for older tracts, evaluate electrical capacity, sewer lateral condition, and prior permit history.  
5. **Employment adjacency:** confirm commute routes to key campuses; peak-hour congestion can materially change travel time variability.
