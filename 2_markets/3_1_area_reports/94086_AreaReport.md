# ZIP Code 94086 — Sunnyvale, California
*Santa Clara County | Central Sunnyvale | Transit-Accessible, Mixed Housing Stock with Strong Tech Adjacency*

## 1. Geological & Physical Setting

### 1.1 Geographic Position
ZIP **94086** covers a broad portion of **central Sunnyvale**, generally east of parts of 94087 and extending toward the city’s central commercial and residential tracts. It benefits from proximity to Downtown Sunnyvale and the broader Sunnyvale/Mountain View employment belt.

### 1.2 Natural Boundaries & Topography
- Predominantly **flat Santa Clara Valley floor** (alluvial plain).
- Lots are generally highly usable; slope/retaining-wall issues are uncommon versus foothill communities.
- Drainage is mainly via engineered stormwater systems; address-level low spots can still matter after heavy rains.

### 1.3 Land Use Patterns
- **Mixed residential**: single-family tracts + meaningful townhome/condo and small multifamily inventory.
- Strong corridor retail and services, including downtown influence and major arterials.
- Built-out fabric; change occurs primarily through **infill**, **redevelopment near transit**, remodels, and ADUs.

## 2. Climate & Environmental Hazards

### 2.1 Local Climate & Weather Patterns
Mediterranean valley climate: warm, dry summers; mild winters. Less marine-layer persistence than Peninsula ZIPs; summer afternoons can be warm.

### 2.2 Wildfire Exposure
Generally **low** for valley-floor Sunnyvale. Address-level verification is prudent, but 94086 is not typically treated as a WUI-driven market.

### 2.3 Flood & Stormwater
Flood risk tends to be **localized** (drainage, near channels, or low points). Best practice is to check FEMA flood zone by address and evaluate site drainage (grading, downspouts, surface flow).

### 2.4 Seismic Considerations
Baseline Bay Area seismic profile. For older housing, practical diligence includes foundation type, settlement indicators, and retrofit/structural history.

### 2.5 Environmental / Legacy Issues
Sunnyvale and adjacent Silicon Valley cities have a broader history of tech-industry groundwater remediation sites. For 94086 residential diligence, rely on disclosures and address context rather than ZIP-wide assumptions.

## 3. Community & Demographics

### 3.1 Neighborhoods & Sub-Areas
Identity is mostly tract- and corridor-driven: Downtown-adjacent neighborhoods, central residential tracts, and corridor-proximate townhome/condo clusters.

### 3.2 Population Profile
High professional/technical workforce concentration; a mix of owners and renters, with density varying sharply by micro-area.

### 3.3 Household Characteristics
- Strong dual-income presence
- Family households in SFH tracts
- Significant renter demand in condo/townhome nodes near commute corridors

---

## 4. Housing & Neighborhood Character

### 4.1 Housing Stock
- SFH tracts largely **1950s–1970s** with continuous remodel activity.
- More condo/townhome inventory than 94087, often closer to arterials and downtown/transit nodes.
- Typical due-diligence themes:
  - Electrical service capacity and panel modernization
  - Sewer lateral condition (home-age dependent)
  - Permit history for additions/ADUs

### 4.2 Market Position (Directional)
94086 is often perceived as:
- **More mixed** (housing types and density) than 94087
- Potentially more **transit/downtown oriented** for some micro-areas
Pricing segments depend heavily on property type, interior-tract vs corridor adjacency, and school assignment.

### 4.3 Income & Affordability
High incomes, but housing affordability remains constrained. Condos/townhomes provide a comparatively accessible entry relative to 94087’s SFH-dominant mix.

### 4.4 Rental Market
Strong rental demand for both multifamily and single-family rentals, driven by job proximity and commute practicality.

## 5. Commute & Access

### 5.1 Transportation
- Excellent roadway access via **US-101, SR-85, I-280** (distance varies).
- Downtown Sunnyvale area improves last-mile options for some commutes.
- Transit utility can be higher than 94087 depending on proximity to stations and employment shuttles.

### 5.2 Commute Patterns (Directional)
- Mountain View / Santa Clara / Cupertino job nodes: short-to-moderate drive times.
- SF commute: feasible with rail connections depending on station access and last-mile needs.

### 5.3 Constraints
Peak-hour congestion remains the primary constraint; built-out roadway network limits large capacity expansions.

---

## 6. Economic Development & Outlook

### 6.1 Employers & Demand Drivers
Demand is supported by adjacency to Sunnyvale/Mountain View/Santa Clara tech campuses and the broader Silicon Valley employment ecosystem.

### 6.2 Commercial Activity
Downtown Sunnyvale and corridor retail/services are important amenities; redevelopment and mixed-use evolution are meaningful in some nodes.

### 6.3 Development Trends
- Infill and redevelopment are more visible than in 94087.
- Ongoing remodel/rebuild in SFH tracts; ADUs increasing.

### 6.4 Outlook
Long-term desirability supported by centrality and employment proximity; short-term conditions remain rate- and tech-cycle sensitive.

## 7. Safety

### 7.1 Crime Profile
Generally low violent crime; property crime is the more relevant category. Corridor-adjacent areas can see more opportunistic incidents than interior tracts.

---

## 8. Schools & Education

### 8.1 District Context (Address-Based)
School assignment varies within 94086 and is **address-based**. Portions are served by:
- Sunnyvale School District (elementary)
- Cupertino Union School District (some pockets, depending on boundaries)
High school is commonly within Fremont Union High School District (boundary-specific).

### 8.2 Buyer Guidance
Because boundaries can materially affect valuation, confirm the exact address using official district tools and do not infer assignment from ZIP alone.

---

## Practical Due-Diligence Checklist (94086)
1. Verify school assignment by exact address (elementary → high school pathway).
2. Confirm FEMA flood zone and inspect site drainage.
3. For older tracts, evaluate electrical capacity, sewer lateral condition, and permit history.
4. Price corridor noise/access tradeoffs explicitly.
5. If buying a condo/townhome, review HOA finances, reserves, and special assessment risk.
