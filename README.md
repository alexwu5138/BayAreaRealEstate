# BayAreaRealEstate: a repo with focus on San Francisco Bay Area real estates

# Purposes 
- This repo is meant to be a single place for useful information related to home buying, selling, exchanging and renting as well as home maintenance 
- Also it serves as an showcase of my personal works


# Rules and Caveats
- As the owner of this repo, I retain the power to bring this whole repo offline or restrict its access to a certain groups of people at any time, without any upfront notices to anyone else. Though said, my intention is to keep it as public as long as possible.
- You are encouraged to contribute to this repo, but your contributor permissions are not always guaranteed, and at the discretion of the repo owner.
- As the owner of the repo, I will not be held responsible for any content of one contributor's input, and I shall not be responsible for failing to do sanitizing or removal in time. I simply lack of that level of time and resources to keep everything in a good shape.
- If a person, no matter what role s/he is playing in the real estate world, is reviewed here, then it is the reviewer rather than me who bears the responsibility of notifying the reviewee.
